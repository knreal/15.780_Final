**Predicting Flight Prices in India Based on Flight Characteristics
**

Airline prices vary drastically based on a variety of factors, but are most impacted by supply and demand. This makes pricing a hard problem for airline companies as it is hard to predict the pricing strategies of their competitors. This begs the question “How should airlines price their tickets to maximize revenue?”. We aim to determine the optimal pricing strategy for an airline that wants to enter the market and compete on price. First, we will construct a predictive model to estimate ticket price for different flights based on a multitude of factors such as: departure time, number of stops, ticket class, flight duration, and the number of days a customer books a ticket before the flight. Then we will use times series analysis to make recommendations for pricing beyond the days given in our dataset.
